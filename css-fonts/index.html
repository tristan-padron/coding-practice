  <h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
  <h2>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h2>
  <p>
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
    markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This
    separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
    characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file,
    and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

<!--Reading Notes!!!-->

<!--Many things to consider with fonts and their applications. Some are commonly usful for certain applications. Weight, style, transform (uppercase, lowercase, capatalize), decoration and stretch(might be referred kerning) are useful. -->

<!-- ~FONT STACK~ : if a user doesn't have a certain font installed on it's computer then the next chosen font will be used. (Fonts must be installed on a users computer in order for them to work)-->
<!--For example, if you wanted serif type, you could write the following:
font-family: Georgia, Times, serif;-->

<!-- ~FONT-FAMILY~: allows you to specity the typefave that should be used for any text inside the element(s).-->
<!--you can specify, size(font-size), -->

<!--this is dumb... but IF A FONT NAME IS MADE OF MORE THAN ONE WORD USE " " aight.-->

<!-- ~LEADING (pronounced ledding): vertical space between lines of text; between ascender and descender.
You would use ~LINE-HEIGHT~ -->

<!-- ~KERNING: space between each letter.
use ~LETTER-SPACING property. Should be given in ems.-->
